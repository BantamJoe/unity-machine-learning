# Run-Forrest-Open-Source

Here is the open source to the Run Forrest! Project, it requires Unity3D to run, & if you want to watch my 4 part devlog on it, here is the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX2Hyu5WoFg

To modify the parameters such as Crossover Function & such, i've made it really easy for you & all you have to do is find the gameobject titled "menuParams" & that has a script called Menu Params that you can modify.

If you want to load your Forrests, simply copy & paste the saved files to the Brains string array also found on the "menuParams" gameobject.

Modify this code until your hearts content, & remember to always feed your curiosity!
